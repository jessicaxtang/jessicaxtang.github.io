            <p class="header__description">In our audible society, those with hearing and speech impairments constantly 
                live in frustration and agony. They face a massive language barrier - if they want to shop or dine out, 
                they can only communicate with those knowing the sign language. Many times, staff are eager to assist the 
                customer with hearing loss, but don't know the sign language. Articulator is the tool to surpass this barrier.<br><br>
                Made with Cohere AI, our clients - staff workers use Articulator to turn their words into American Sign Language 
                to assist their customers. Simply speak into the microphone, and a video composed of the correct sign language 
                will play and allow the customer to understand your thoughts. Because sign languages heavily uses body expressions, 
                Articulator displays a sentiment emoji to convey the sentiment of the sentence, helping the customer better understand 
                your words. <br><br> Articulator uses 6 different AI models. First, a speech recognition model converts your words to text. 
                Then, a Cohere summarizer is used to simplify long speeches into digestible words. The text is then passed to a Cohere 
                toxicity classifier, sentence by sentence, to detect noninclusive and toxic sentences, and all harmful sentences are passed 
                through a Cohere generator to rephrase and clarify it. Finally, Cohere sentiment analysis is performed to gauge the sentiment 
                of the text, and words or word groups are matched with a library of sign language videos. For words not found in the library 
                of videos, we use Cohere Embed to find the closest word to replace it semantically.</p>
